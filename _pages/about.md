This is my GitHub portfolio! I am currently a student in Hocking Collegeâ€™s Cybersecurity and Networking program. I am hoping to get as much experience as possible and earn some certifications.I am passionate about Cybersecurity and hoping to pursue my bachelor's degree. I want to use my education to spread awareness about security threats.  

# My interests 

I love punk rock and post-hardcore music! I play bass, am learning to DJ, and I can play the Tuba. I collect Transformers and Star Wars figurines. I also adore comic books! I'm a huge fan of The Walking Dead, Invincible, IDW's Tranformers, and SkyBound's Transformers series.
